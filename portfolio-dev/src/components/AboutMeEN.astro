  Since I finished my degree in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> till now, I have not stopped studying and upgrading my developing skills. 
</p>

<p>
  In my first job, I discovered the world of <strong>APIs</strong> and how they help building <strong>efficient and scalable solutions</strong>, enabling communications between the different components in the backend.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to this position, I had the opportunity to collaborate with <strong>international teams</strong>, gaining valuable insights into <strong>different working styles</strong> and modeling a <strong>global perspective</strong> on technologies.

  Nowadays, I am actively <strong>seeking challenges</strong> to enhance my skills, fueled by a <strong>strong motivation to continue learning</strong> and diving deeper into the fascinating realm of development.
